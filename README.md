# OGRE

## Pr√©sentation workshop OGRE

Ogre is a recreational workshop to help understand orders of magnitude of energies and what it implies for the ecological transition.

https://laconsciencedesetudiants.fr/atelier-ogre/

## Goal of this project

Our goal is to develop a web application to digitalize OGRE's workshop. It will improve the user experience and allow to scale up the reach of the workshop.

## Features

Work In Progress

## Tech

OGRE uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Backend
  - **Node.js** - evented I/O for the backend
  - **Express** - fast node.js network app framework
- Frontend
  - **React** : Framework/library for front-end dev

## Development

1. Run "yarn env:default" from root, it will set default .env values in server
2. Run "yarn install" from root, it will install all dependencies in all workspaces
3. Run "yarn db:up" from root, it will lauch a postgre container
4. Run "yarn db:migrate" from root, it creates the tables in the database
5. Run "yarn db:seed" from root, it feeds the database with some dummy database
6. Run "yarn workspace ogre-client dev" to launch client
7. In another shell run "yarn-workspace ogre-server db:generate to link Prisma configuration with env variables.
8. Run "yarn workspace ogre-server dev" to launch server

### Running frontend and backend apps

Please refer to README.md in `/server` and `/client` folders.

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to heroku. A procfile is not needed as the "start" and "build" script are executed by default: https://help.heroku.com/P5IMU3MP/heroku-node-js-build-script-change-faq

A postGreSQL database is required, the connection string must be set as DATABASE_URL in the secrets.

### Testing deployment locally

Node, npm et Docker must be installed locally.

1. Run "yarn env:default" from root, it will set default .env values in server
2. Run "yarn install" from root, it will install all dependencies in all workspaces
3. Run "yarn build" from root, it will transpile all typescript in all workspaces
4. Run "yarn db:up" from root, it will lauch a postgre container
5. Run "yarn db:migrate" from root, it creates the tables in the database
6. Run "yarn start" from root

App should be up at http://localhost:8080/
